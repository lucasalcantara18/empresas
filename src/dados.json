We foster a change of perception, not only by our users but also by those who are not disabled, generating an integrative revolution. We seek to make a difference from the practicality, technology and quality of our products, allowing those who use them to lead a healthy and outdoor life. Toruk has two hooks that connect to the wheelchair on both sides, causing the two front wheels to rise making both parts end up becoming a tricycle. It is propelled with both hands and the weight of the head and body are used for propulsion. It can be attached to every wheelchair, it decreases the risk of falling due to wells and sidewalks, something very frequent in Argentina, and it helps to improve the aerobic capacity of its users. Toruk's propulsion, unlike the movement required by the wheelchair, does not harm the arms. ",
